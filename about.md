#  **Neo**
## The Prophecy: The coming of The One will herald the destruction of the Matrix and the freedom of humanity from their oppression by the Machines. Once The One enters the Source, he will have the power to destroy the Matrix. ##

## Backstory ##

### Neo started as just a regular computer programmer. His life becomes very interesting when he’s attacked by mysterious men called the Agents and confronted by a man named Morpheus. Morpheus tells him about the Matrix. A simulation that everyone in the entire world is living in. He gives Neo an ultimatum, “ You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” He gives Neo the choice to escape the Matrix or to live in it. Neo escapes the Matrix and finds out that all of humanity has been enslaved by the Machines. After some back-and-forth fighting, Neo ends up becoming The One. He defeats the Agents and starts the rest of his journey to free everyone from the Matrix ###

## Use of the Chosen Ones Trope ##

### The writers of The Matrix, the Wachowski siblings, used the Chosen One Trope as a literary device to show the inner struggle of being branded a savior. Throughout the movie, Neo struggles with the concept of the Matrix and the role he is supposed to play in it. After Morpheus explained the Matrix to Neo he said, “ I don’t like the idea that I’m not in control of my life.” His inner strife is only pushed further when everyone tells him that he is supposed to be their savior. Until the end of the movie, Neo doubts himself and this struggle makes the movie that much more interesting. Just when Neo is about to be killed by the Agents, he comes into his role as “The One”. He defeats the Agents and finally becomes the savior and hero he was meant to be. ###
