# **Anakin Skywalker** #
## The Prophecy: Someone will be born who is destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the force ##

## Backstory ##

### In the Star Wars Saga, Anakin Skywalker is The Chosen One. The creator of the Star Wars universe, George Lucas, uses this prophecy to send Anakin down a tragic path. After training to become a Jedi for some time, Anakin became one of the strongest. Although, the Council wouldn’t give him the title of ‘Master’. This angered Anakin. Anakin grew up hearing that he was The Chosen One and it made him start to thirst for power. Anakin also fell in love with a woman named Padme. Anakin’s love for her was strong but it was against the Jedi code because they were supposed to never get emotionally attached to others. Even though it was against the rules Anakin said this, “I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just being around her again is... intoxicating.” Unfortunately, Anakin kept having visions that his wife would die. His fear of losing Padme drove him to turn to the Dark side. His wife, Padme, ended up dying in childbirth and Anakin challenged his master, Obi-Wan, to a fight to the death. Anakin lost but ended up surviving as a shell of the man he once was. ###

## Use of Chosen Ones Trope ##

### This tragic tale forces the watchers to ponder the difference between destiny and free will. Was it Anakin's free will that led him down his path to the Dark side or was it all a part of his destiny and the Jedi prophecy? Some would say that Anakin’s evil acts were all a part of the prophecy. Since later in the story Anakin’s son, Luke Skywalker, brought balance to the force after redeeming his father. If Anakin had never become evil, the prophecy would’ve never beeen fulfilled. However, does that mean that Anakin never had free will? If Anakin never became evil would he have destroyed the Sith himself? This contemplation is may never have an end. Deep topics like this were created by George Lucas through the use of the Chosen One Trope ###
